Now that we are well acquainted with power apps and creating a microsoft graph custom connector in it, let us familiarize ourselves with the following terms once so that we can proceed to call Microsoft graph API in Power Automate using custome connectors for which we will require to set the criteria in authentication.

## Azure API Management Gateway
Custom connectors are supported by Microsoft Azure API Management infrastructure. When a connection to the underlying API is created, the API Management gateway stores the API credentials or tokens, depending on the type of authentication used, on a per-connection basis in a token store. This solution enables authentication at the connection level.

## Azure API Authentication
Before using any connector in Azure Logic Apps, Power Automate, or Power Apps, the user needs to create a connection by authenticating to the network service. There are different types of authentication. 
1. No authentication- No further information is required. 
2. Basic authentication- The user will provide the user name and password to create the connection. 
3. API Key- Used by web services. Make sure that you define- Parameter label, Parameter name, Parameter location
4. OAuth 2.0 authentication- Available for online connectors. Provides implementations for specific services and prebuilt identity provider templates, when selected, fill in many of the fields that are required by OAuth 2.0.
5. Windows authentication- Available only for connections that use on-premises data gateway, when the Connect via on-premises data gateway check box is set on the General tab. When a new connection is created, the user will need to provide Windows credentials for the service and then select one of the installed on-premises gateways.

## Prerequisites
An account on [Power Apps Portal](https://make.powerapps.com/), [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer), [Microsoft Azure](portal.azure.com).

## Let's get started!

**Step 1:** Create a new solution.
1. Go to [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/) and make sure to be in the correct environment.
2. Select Solutions > + New solution and enter the following details. 
3. Don't navigate away from this page after selecting 'Create'.

**Step 2:** Use Graph Explorer to test the API.
1. Sign in to the [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) and use it to test the API. Read the permissions and continue if you agree.
2. Make sure that GET is selected for the verb, add /insights/used to the URL, and then select Run query.
3. You should get a 403 error indicating that Graph Explorer lacks your permission to perform this action.
4. Select the Modify permissions tab to grant Graph Explorer permission > Select Sites.Read.All > Consent.
5. Read the requested permissions, continue if you agree and select Run query again.

8. Enter some test text in the Word file. The document will be saved automatically for you.
9. Go back to the Graph Explorer and run the same query again.
10. You should now get a response with values. Select the response JSON, right-click, select Copy, and then save it.

**Step 3:** Register a new application and add permissions.
1. Sign in to [Microsoft Azure](portal.azure.com) with your user admin credentials.
2. Select Show portal menu and then select Azure Active Directory.

5. Select Certificates & secrets and + New client secret.
6. Enter Last used connector action for Description, select In 1 year for Expires, and then select Add.
7. Copy the Value and save it for later because it won't be shown again. You will use this user secret when creating the connector.
8. Select Overview, copy the Application (Client) ID and save it on a notepad. You'll use this client ID when creating the connector.
